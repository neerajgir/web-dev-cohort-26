# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This file contains short, practical steps to get started. For larger projects, expand this into a full CONTRIBUTING.md.

- Fork the repository and create a short-lived feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
- Keep changes small and focused; open a PR against `main` (or the repo's default branch).
- Run the site locally (`npm install` → `npm run dev`) and verify visual changes in the browser.
- Use descriptive commit messages and reference related issues in PR descriptions.
- For style and formatting changes, update `src/style.css` and include screenshots in the PR when applicable.

If the repository adds automated checks later (linting, tests, CI), follow those standards and update this document accordingly.
